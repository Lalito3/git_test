        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Prepare the dough
                <ul>
                    <li>In a small bowl, combine the warm water, sugar, and yeast. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy.</li>
                    <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the center and pour in the yeast mixture and olive oil.</li>
                    <li>Mix until it forms a dough. If using a stand mixer, knead the dough with a dough hook attachment for about 5-7 minutes. If kneading by hand, transfer the dough to a floured surface and knead for about 8-10 minutes until smooth and elastic.</li>
                    <li>Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover it with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1-1.5 hours until it doubles in size.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Preheat the oven:

                Preheat your oven to the highest temperature it can go, usually around 475°F (245°C) to 500°F (260°C). Place a pizza stone or an upside-down baking sheet in the oven while it preheats.</li>
            <li>Roll out the dough:

                After the dough has risen, punch it down and divide it into two equal portions (for two pizzas). On a floured surface, roll out each portion of dough into a circle or rectangle, depending on your preference, about ¼ inch thick.</li>
            <li><ul>Assemble the pizza:
                <li>Carefully transfer the rolled-out dough to a piece of parchment paper (for easy transfer to the oven). Spread pizza sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border for the crust.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce, then add your desired toppings.</li>
            </ul></li>
            <li><ul>Bake the pizza:
                <li>Using a pizza peel or another baking sheet, carefully transfer the assembled pizza (on the parchment paper) onto the preheated pizza stone or baking sheet in the oven.</li>
                <li>Bake for about 10-15 minutes or until the crust is golden brown, the cheese is melted and bubbly, and the toppings are cooked to your liking.</li>
            </ul></li>
            <li>Serve:

                Once done, carefully remove the pizza from the oven. Allow it to cool for a minute or two before slicing. Slice and serve hot!</li>
