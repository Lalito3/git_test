        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

            <li>1 pound (450g) ground beef (80/20 blend recommended)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
            <li>4 hamburger buns</li>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the patties: In a mixing bowl, gently combine the ground beef, salt, and black pepper. If using, add Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, and onion powder as well. Be careful not to overwork the meat, as this can make the burgers tough. Divide the mixture into 4 equal portions and shape them into patties slightly larger than the burger buns (they will shrink during cooking).</li>
            <li>Preheat the grill or skillet: If using a grill, preheat it to medium-high heat. If using a skillet, heat it over medium-high heat on the stovetop.</li>
            <li>Cook the patties: Place the patties on the grill or skillet. Cook for approximately 4-5 minutes on each side for medium-rare to medium doneness. If you prefer your burgers more well-done, cook for an additional 1-2 minutes per side. Add a slice of cheese on top of each patty during the last minute of cooking to melt.</li>
            <li>Prepare the buns: While the patties are cooking, lightly toast the hamburger buns on the grill or in the skillet for about 1-2 minutes, until they're lightly golden brown.</li>
            <li>Place the cooked patties with melted cheese on the bottom half of each toasted bun. Add your desired toppings (lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, etc.) and condiments (ketchup, mustard, mayo, etc.) on top of the patties.</li>
            <li> Place the top half of the bun over the toppings to complete the burgers. Serve immediately while warm.</li>
